   "source": "At the base of everything are the two modules [<code>core</code>](/core.html#fastai.core) and [<code>torch_core</code>](/torch_core.html#fastai.torch_core) (we're not including the `fastai.` prefix when naming modules in these docs). They define the basic functions we use in the library; [<code>core</code>](/core.html#fastai.core) only relies on general modules, whereas [<code>torch_core</code>](/torch_core.html#fastai.torch_core) requires pytorch. Most type-hinting shortcuts are defined there too (at least the one that don't depend on fastai classes defined later). Nearly all modules below import [<code>torch_core</code>](/torch_core.html#fastai.torch_core).\n\nThen, there are three modules directly on top of [<code>torch_core</code>](/torch_core.html#fastai.torch_core): \n- [<code>data</code>](/data.html#fastai.data), which contains the class that will take a [<code>Dataset</code>](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset) or pytorch [<code>DataLoader</code>](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) to wrap it in a [<code>DeviceDataLoader</code>](/data.html#DeviceDataLoader) (a class that sits on top of a [<code>DataLoader</code>](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) and is in charge of putting the data on the right device as well as applying transforms such as normalization) and regroup then in a [<code>DataBunch</code>](/data.html#DataBunch).\n- [<code>layers</code>](/layers.html#fastai.layers), which contains basic functions to define custom layers or groups of layers\n- [<code>metrics</code>](/metrics.html#fastai.metrics), which contains all the metrics\n\nFrom [<code>layers</code>](/layers.html#fastai.layers), we have all the modules in the models folder that are defined. Then from [<code>data</code>](/data.html#fastai.data) we can split on one of the four main *applications*, which each has their own module: [<code>vision</code>](/vision.html#fastai.vision), [<code>text</code>](/text.html#fastai.text) [<code>colab</code>](/colab.html#fastai.colab), or [<code>tabular</code>](/tabular.html#fastai.tabular). Each of those submodules is built in the same way with:\n- a submodule named `transform` that handles the transformations of our data (data augmentation for computer vision, numericalizing and tokenizing for text and preprocessing for tabular)\n- a submodule named [<code>data</code>](/data.html#fastai.data) that contains the class that will create datasets and the helper functions to create [<code>DataBunch</code>](/data.html#DataBunch) objects.\n\nThis takes care of building your model and handling the data. We regroup those in a [<code>Learner</code>](/basic_train.html#Learner) object to take care of training. More specifically:\n- [<code>callback</code>](/callback.html#fastai.callback) defines the basis of callbacks and the [<code>CallbackHandler</code>](/callback.html#CallbackHandler). Those are functions that will be called every step of the way of the training loop and can allow us to customize what is happening there;\n- [<code>basic_train</code>](/basic_train.html#fastai.basic_train) defines [<code>Learner</code>](/basic_train.html#Learner) and [<code>Recorder</code>](/basic_train.html#Recorder) (which is a callback that records stats and takes care of updating the progress bars) and have the training loop;\n- [<code>callbacks</code>](/callbacks.html#fastai.callbacks) is a submodule defining various callbacks;\n- `learn` defines helper functions to invoke the callbacks more easily.\n\nThe module [<code>tta</code>](/tta.html#fastai.tta) (for Test Time Augmentation) depends on [<code>basic_train</code>](/basic_train.html#fastai.basic_train), the module [<code>colab</code>](/colab.html#fastai.colab) (for collaborative filtering) depends on [<code>basic_train</code>](/basic_train.html#fastai.basic_train) and [<code>layers</code>](/layers.html#fastai.layers), so does the module `conv_learner` (for our models with a skeleton trained on imagenet and a custom head for classification) and the module `rnn_learn` (to automatically get learner objects for NLP) depends on [<code>callbacks</code>](/callbacks.html#fastai.callbacks) (specifically the [<code>rnn</code>](/callbacks.rnn.html#fastai.callbacks.rnn) callback) and [<code>models</code>](/models.html#fastai.models) (specifically the rnn models).\n\nHere is a graph of the key module dependencies:"
