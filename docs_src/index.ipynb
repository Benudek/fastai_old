They define the basic functions we use in the library; [<code>core</code>](/core.html#fastai.core) only relies on general modules, whereas [<code>torch_core</code>](/torch_core.html#fastai.torch_core) requires pytorch. Most type-hinting shortcuts are defined there too (at least the one that don't depend on fastai classes defined later). Nearly all modules below import [<code>torch_core</code>](/torch_core.html#fastai.torch_core).\n",
