## Current Status

This is a ground-up rewrite of fastai. Everything should work, although docs are still in progress. If you're interested in contributing, join the discussion at: http://forums.fast.ai/c/fastai-dev.

## Install

To use the notebooks or the first modules in the fastai directory you will need:
- to use python 3.7 or python 3.6 with [dataclasses](https://github.com/ericvsmith/dataclasses): `pip install dataclasses`
- to use the `pytorch-nightly` conda package, or the master branch of [pytorch master](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source)
